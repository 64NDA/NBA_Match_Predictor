This is a small project to try and predict nba scorelines and match outcomes using ai machine learning algorithms (random forest algorithm).
INitially, devloped webscraper to collect all the data, this includes results and advanced statistics for entire nba 2024 season,
Then using pandas, scikit learn, formatted data:
then in order to use statistics, trailed various methods to implement a way to look at past statistics, collate them and use those statistics to predict matches
used various methods settled on exponential decay (opposed to mean of last...) in future could implement exponential decay of last 20...
using this, plugged data into model, tuned model to achieve a score prediction of root (mse), ie error margin of around 14 points.
60% accuracy on results, this is hard. most Models end up learning towards teams potenitally winning then losing.
